# ScriptCalc (ipad-tools)

**ScriptCalc** is a self-contained, browser-based scientific calculator with MATLAB-style syntax. The entire application lives in a single file — [`index.html`](index.html) — with all CSS and JavaScript inline, so there is **no build step, no server, and no install**. Open the file in a browser and it works.

It is designed to run well on:

- an **iPad with internet access** (libraries load from CDNs), and
- a **Windows PC with or without internet access** (offline use requires the local library files described in [Offline setup](#offline-setup-windows-pc-without-internet)).

## Quick start

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click, or serve it from any static host such as GitHub Pages).
2. Type commands in the left/top **Input** pane.
3. Press **Shift+Enter** or the **Run** button (▶ floating button on mobile) to execute.
4. Results appear in the **Console** tab; plots appear in the **Graph** tab.

Your code is auto-saved to the browser's `localStorage` as you type, so it survives page reloads. **Reset** clears the editor (with confirmation). **Cheatsheet** opens a quick-reference modal; **Help** opens a full documentation page in a new tab.

## Feature overview

### MATLAB-style math & plotting

Powered by [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) for evaluation and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for rendering.

```matlab
figure
x = range(0, 10, 0.1)
plot(x, sin(x))        # sin() is auto-vectorized over arrays
hold on
plot(x, cos(x))
legend('sin(x)', 'cos(x)')
title('Sine and Cosine')
xlabel('X'); ylabel('Y')
```

- `figure`, `plot(x, y)`, `hold on` / `hold off`, `title()`, `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, `legend()`
- Advanced form: `plot([trace1, trace2], layout)` passes raw Plotly trace/layout objects
- Element-wise operators `.*`, `./`, `.^` (rewritten to `dotMultiply`/`dotDivide`/`dotPow` before evaluation)
- Auto-vectorized functions: `sin cos tan asin acos atan sinh cosh tanh exp log log10 log2 sqrt abs sign` work on scalars, arrays, and matrices
- Matrices: `[1, 2; 3, 4]`, `identity(n, m)`, `inv()`, matrix vs. element-wise multiply
- Each console line that generates a graph gets a clickable "Graph N generated" link that jumps to it

### Date & time (Luxon)

- `now(zone)` — current time as ISO string; `Denver`, `Mechelen`, `Sydney` are predefined zone constants
- `prettydate(iso)` — formats as `yyyy_MM_dd_HHmm MMM dd hh:mma EEE`
- `toZone(iso, zone)`, `date(str)`, `dateDiff(d1, d2, unit)`
- `ThreeZonesNow()` / `ThreeZones(timestamp)` — the same instant in Denver, Mechelen, and Sydney
- Date arithmetic via overloaded `+`/`-`: `now() + 30 minutes`, `today + 1 week`, and `date1 - date2` returns a human-readable duration ("2 years, 3 months, …"). ISO date strings printed to the console get an inline pretty-formatted badge.

### Currency conversion

USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, and CAD are registered as math.js **units**, so conversion uses the same natural syntax as physical units:

```matlab
showrates()          # current rates + their age
100 USD in EUR
price = 25.50 EUR
price in USD
```

Rates are fetched from `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD`, cached in `localStorage` for **1 hour**, and fall back to hardcoded approximate rates when offline. Diagnostics: `checkcurrency()`, `refreshcurrency()`.

### Unit conversions

Everything math.js supports: `1 kg in lbs`, `25 degC in degF`, `3 teaspoons in ml`, plus a custom `toFeetInches(180 cm)` → `5' 10.87"`.

### Timers & stopwatch

- `timer(3 minutes)` / `timer(90)` (bare numbers = seconds) — floating countdown overlay with an audio alert at zero; `timerCancel()`
- `stopwatchStart()`, `stopwatchStop()`, `stopwatchReset()` — floating elapsed-time overlay
- One timer and one stopwatch at a time

### Text utilities

- `nato('Hello')` → NATO phonetic alphabet (`Hotel Echo Lima Lima Oscar`)
- `latex('\alpha \to \beta')` → Unicode (`α → β`), automatically copied to the clipboard (uses the [unicodeit](https://github.com/svenkreiss/unicodeit) library)
- `printf("x = %.2f\n", x)` — C-style formatted output (`%s`, `%d`, `%f`, precision specs)

### Cochlear implant (CIC4) helpers

Current-level conversions for cochlear implant work, preloaded into the parser scope on every run:

- `CL2uAzp(CL)` — converts a CIC4 current level (0–255) to microamps: `17.5 · 100^(CL/255)`
- `uAzp2CL(I)` — the inverse: `255 · log10(I/17.5) / 2`

### Script conventions

| Syntax | Effect |
|---|---|
| `# comment` or `% comment` | Line is skipped |
| trailing `;` | Evaluate but suppress console output |
| `exit` | Stop execution; everything below is ignored |
| **Shift+Enter** | Run the script |

The **entire script re-runs from scratch** on every Run: the parser scope is cleared and re-seeded, the console is cleared, and all graphs are regenerated.

## Offline setup (Windows PC without internet)

`index.html` loads its three libraries from CDNs, and each `<script>` tag has an `onerror` fallback that loads a **local file from the same folder** instead. Those local files are **not committed to this repo**. The easy way to produce them (requires Node.js, one-time, online):

```bash
npm install
npm run setup     # copies the pinned library builds next to index.html
```

Or download them manually and place them next to `index.html` with these exact names:

| Local filename | Download from |
|---|---|
| `math.js` | https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjs/12.4.0/math.min.js |
| `luxon.js` | https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/luxon/3.4.4/luxon.min.js |
| `plotly.min.js` | https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.27.0.min.js |
| `unicodeit.js` | a browser (non-module) build of [unicodeit](https://github.com/svenkreiss/unicodeit) that sets `window.unicodeitLib` |

Note that `unicodeit.js` is the reverse of the others: it is loaded **local-first**, with an ES-module CDN fallback (`esm.sh`) if the local file is missing.

Offline behavior notes:

- If neither CDN nor local files load, the app shows a "Missing Files" diagnostic listing what's absent (5-second timeout).
- Currency conversion works offline using the last cached rates (up to 1 hour old is treated as fresh; older cached rates are still used if the fetch fails) or the hardcoded fallback rates.
- `latex()` needs either the local `unicodeit.js` or network access.

## Architecture / developer map

Everything is in `index.html` (~1,800 lines). Reading order for future feature work:

| Section | Location (approx.) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Loader & fallback logic** | `<head>`, top | `window.loadFallback` swaps a failed CDN `<script>` for its local twin; `window.scriptErrors` feeds the missing-files diagnostic UI |
| **Styles** | `<style>` in `<head>` | CSS variables, split-pane layout, tabs, modal, mobile breakpoint at 768px (stacked panes + FAB) |
| **Markup** | `<body>` | Header buttons, input `<textarea>`, output panel with Console/Graph tabs, cheatsheet `<dialog>` |
| **Currency subsystem** | top of main `<script>` | `fetchExchangeRates` → `localStorage` cache → `createCurrencyUnits` (defines `USD/EUR/GBP/AUD/CAD` + lowercase aliases as math.js units, deleting old definitions first) |
| **Figure state & rendering** | after currency code | `currentFigure` / `holdState` module globals, `createNewFigure()`, `renderFigure()` (appends a labeled Plotly div to `#graphs-container`), `jumpToGraph()` |
| **`initMath()`** | middle | The heart of the app: one big `math.import({...}, {override: true})` call registering every custom function (plotting commands, auto-vectorized math, dates, currency helpers, timers, `nato`, `latex`, `printf`, …). Runs once dependencies are polled ready, then creates the persistent `math.parser()` |
| **`preloadScopeFunctions()`** | near bottom | Re-seeds parser scope each run: `CL2uAzp`, `uAzp2CL`, and the `Denver`/`Mechelen`/`Sydney` zone-string constants |
| **`runCalculation()`** | near bottom | The interpreter loop: split input into lines → skip comments → handle `exit` and `;` → **regex preprocessing** (`hold on` → `hold('on')`; `.*`/`./`/`.^` → `dotMultiply`/`dotDivide`/`dotPow`; escape backslashes inside `latex('…')`) → `parser.evaluate(line)` → format result (matrix table via `formatMatrix`, graph-link markers, pretty-date badges, HTML-escaped strings) |
| **Full help page** | `showFullHelp()` | A complete standalone HTML documentation page embedded as a template string, opened via `window.open` + `document.write` |

### Extension points

- **New calculator function** → add it to the `math.import({...})` block in `initMath()`. Return a string for console output, or `""` for silent commands.
- **New user-defined constant/function available in scripts** → add a `parser.evaluate(...)` line to `preloadScopeFunctions()`.
- **New syntax sugar** (MATLAB-isms) → add a regex rewrite in the preprocessing section of `runCalculation()`, alongside the `hold on` and dot-operator rewrites.
- **New currency** → add it to `FALLBACK_RATES`, the rate extraction in `fetchExchangeRates()`, the unit creation/deletion lists in `createCurrencyUnits()`, and `showrates()`/`checkcurrency()`.
- **New output rendering** (like the graph links) → the result-formatting branch inside `runCalculation()`; string results matching `GRAPH_LINK:<n>` show how to smuggle rich output through the evaluator.

### Quirks & known limitations worth remembering

- The dot-operator regex rewriting is **per-line and pattern-based**, not a real parser — deeply nested or chained `.*` expressions with parenthesized operands may not rewrite correctly.
- The whole script re-executes on every run; there is no incremental/cell evaluation and no persistent state between runs (by design — it keeps output reproducible).
- `latex()` clipboard copy fails silently in contexts where the Clipboard API is unavailable (e.g. non-HTTPS file:// on some browsers); the converted string is still shown.
- Trig functions are replaced with native-JS-`Math` wrappers for speed/vectorization, so they **lose math.js unit/complex-number support** (e.g. `sin(45 deg)` no longer works — use radians).
- Only 5 currencies are wired up; rates are all quoted against USD.
- The help page relies on `window.open` — pop-up blockers can suppress it.
- Timer audio uses an embedded base64 WAV and may be blocked until the user has interacted with the page.

## Development & testing

The app itself needs no tooling — everything below is **dev-only** and has zero effect on how fast `index.html` loads or runs (nothing here ships in the page; `node_modules/` and the local libs are gitignored).

The test suite drives the **real `index.html` in a real (headless) browser** with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/): it types scripts into the editor, clicks Run, and asserts on the console output, Plotly graph data, overlays, and localStorage. CDN hosts are deliberately blocked during tests so every run also proves the offline fallback path works, and the exchange-rate API is mocked for deterministic currency numbers.

```bash
npm install                  # once: test tooling + pinned library packages
npm run setup                # once: produce local lib files (tests need them)
npx playwright install       # once: browser for Playwright (if not present)
npm test                     # run the full suite
npx playwright test tests/dates.spec.js   # run one spec file
```

(If your environment provides its own Chromium build, point at it with `PW_CHROMIUM_PATH=/path/to/chrome npm test` instead of `npx playwright install`.)

Test map (`tests/`):

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `interpreter.spec.js` | comments, `;` suppression, `exit`, errors, scope reset between runs |
| `operators-vectorization.spec.js` | `.*` `./` `.^`, auto-vectorized functions, matrices |
| `plotting.spec.js` | `figure`/`plot`/`hold`/`legend`/labels, multi-figure, raw-trace form |
| `dates.spec.js` | `now`/`prettydate`/`toZone`/`dateDiff`, date `+`/`-` overloads, ThreeZones |
| `currency.spec.js` | conversions with mocked rates, offline fallback rates, diagnostics |
| `utilities.spec.js` | `printf`, `nato`, `toFeetInches`, `latex`, CIC4 conversions |
| `timers.spec.js` | countdown timer and stopwatch lifecycles |
| `app-shell.spec.js` | default code, persistence, Shift+Enter, Reset, missing-libs diagnostic |

**Working agreement for new features (TDD):** write the failing spec first (or extend an existing spec file), then implement in `index.html`, then run `npm test`. Refactors of `index.html` are only done under green tests.
